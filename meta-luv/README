I. Adding the meta-luv layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the meta-luv layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the meta-luv layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-luv \
    "

II. Building LUV
=================================================

LUV can boot from either a local network or a disk. The process to build
is slightly different for each case.

If you intend to build an image to boot from a physical disk, then it is
necessary to specify the luv distribution in local.conf.
e.g.:

  DISTRO = "luv"

Afterwards, you can simply do:

  bitbake luv-live-image

If you intend to build an image to boot from a local network, then it is
necessary to specify the luv-netboot distribution in local.conf.
e.g.:

  DISTRO = "luv-netboot"

Afterwards, you can simply do:

  bitbake luv-netboot-image

III. Executing ACPI NFIT destructive tests
=================================================

The NDCTL test suite includes a batch of destructive tests. These are
disabled by default. If the user wants to execute these destructive
tests, the luv.nfit-destructive option needs to be passed as a kernel
parameter. This can be done by adding this option to the grub linux
command that loads the Linux kernel. The file to implement this change
is EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg located in the bootable partition of the LUV
media.

IV. Use of Netconsole in LUV
=================================================

Netconsole is a Linux feature and a kernel module that sends all
kernel log messages to a remote machine over the network. It does not
have all overwhelming userspace messages and pretty convenient when
a serial console is unavailable. Netconsole (network console) is just
an alternative to serial console.

Why Netconsole?
---------------
As already stated, it comes in handy when no serial console is
available and, importantly, it is a powerful kernel debugging tool.
It sends the kernel log messages(dmesg)to a different machine over
UDP packets and helps in debugging when there is system hang.

Why in LUV?
-----------
LUV is used to test systems for any firmware issues and there is
a possibility that the system may hang during the execution of LUV.
It is very important that LUV gets the debug information
to narrow down the causes and provide support to its users.

Usage in LUV
------------
In order to make use of the netconsole feature in LUV users must be
aware of its usage.

The current release of luv-netconsole could support Linux and Microsoft
Windows hosts and remote machines. However, at the moment it is only
possible to make changes in the grub.cfg file using a Linux system.
This file is available in the second partition of the image mounted
or flashed in a USB stick.

Choose the IP address and port number where you want all messages
to be sent to. Once decided, you can replace the dummy IP address and
port number given in grub.cfg as luv_netconsole=10.11.12.13,64001
(the IP address and port number respectively).

The grub.cfg file is located in boot partition. The location is
EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg. Edit the file to meet the needs of netconsole.

On the remote machine, use netcat or nc to listen all the messages
that are being sent:

   $ netcat -l -u <port number> (or)  nc -l -u <port number>
example:
   $ netcat -l -u 64001

Steps on how to get IP address and choose port number
-----------------------------------------------------
On your terminal do

   $ ifconfig

Look for interfaces like eth0, eth1, lo and wlan0. All the ethernet
interfaces are eth0, eth1 .., and lo is the loopback interface
(system uses to communicate with itself), and wireless interfaces
are wlan0, wlan1 etc. There can be interfaces (usually unamed by user
while setting up) other than the ones mentioned here.

Now look for 'inet addr' in available interfaces other than lo. If
you want to use wireless network look in 'wlan' interfaces, or look in
ethernet 'eth' interfaces etc.

inet addr is the IP address we are looking for.

Choose port numbers which are not reserved for any kernel activities
like 4000's and above. port 64001 is chosen in luv-netconsole.

V. Obtaining debug information
=================================================

Sometimes is the execution of tests may end unexpectedly. In this kind
of situations could be useful to see how much the test manager
progresses and, maybe, identify the offending test case. To enable
this option, you need to add luv.debug in the parameters that grub
passes to Linux via the linux command. The grub configuration file
is located in EFI/BOOT/grub.cfg in the test results partition (the
first partition you see in the LUV disk).

When luv.debug is enabled, the LUV test manager will leave a file
named luv-debug.log inside the time-stamped directory luv-results-
yyyy-mm-dd--hh-mm--ss with the debug data it collected.

VI. Other LUV boot parameters
=================================================

These parameters can be also added to the linux kernel command line
to alter the default behaviour of LUV.
  noluv
    Do not start the LUV test suite after booting
  luv.netboot
    Force LUV to believe it has been booted over a network.
    (Currently this only sets test output to /tmp/luv-storage)
  luv.halt
    Halts the machine after tests have completed. (Calls /sbin/halt)
  luv.reboot
    Reboots the machine after tests have completed (Calls /sbin/reboot)
  luv.poweroff
    Halts and powers off the machine after tests have completed.
    (Calls /sbin/poweroff)
  luv.telemetrics
    User wants to enable the telemetrics feature. By doing so, they are
    agreeing to send data to our server for further analysis.By default,
    feature is disabled.
  luv.crash
    This kernel parameter will tell us if we are in a regular boot.If so,
    we have to prepare everything in case there is a kernel crash in the
    future. Unlike the other LUV boot parameters, this one is not intended
    to be used directly.

VII. Submitting results to a remote location
==============================================

When LUV boots via network (netboot), there is no way of storing the results
as there is no presence of physical media. It can be useful if there is a way to
store the results such as sending them to a central location over network.
Sending the results over network can only be possible if LUV knows where the
results should be sent to. One possible way is to store the results to a
website/server. LUV should have the information about the website/server like an
URL.

LUV_STORAGE_URL is a parameter in the file 'luv.cfg' that stores the URL of a
website/server. One has to make sure that the url is functional and the server
is accessible to the admin/user to retrieve the results. When this parameter is
invalid, LUV will not have the capability of sending the test results to the
desired location (website/server).

Configuring a server to gather test results
-------------------------------------------
The format of the parameter LUV_STORAGE_URL typically looks like this
LUV_STORAGE_URL=http://ipaddress/cgi-bin/upload.php (as mentioned in luv.cfg)

The website/server that is going to store the results is a HTTP server and at
the moment LUV does not have the capability of resolving the hostname in to an
ipaddress and thus, it is necessary to provide an IP address. If you are not
sure on how to get the ipaddress please follow
'Steps on how to get IP address and choose port number' in section IV.

It is always good and recommended to have a destined directory/folder
specifically for storing results. The path of this destined folder/directory is
listed in a script (upload.php) that is in the cgi-bin directory. This script is
responsible for uploads using HTTP POST method.

User/developer has to make sure that upload.php script is present in cgi-bin
directory.

$ cd /usr/lib/cgi-bin/
/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ ls
upload.php

If you do not have a server setup or do not have a upload.php script, please
follow the documentation
https://github.com/01org/luv-yocto/wiki/Send--LUV-test-results-to-an-HTTP-server

Configuring a LUV client
------------------------

Diskboot: In diskboot image, one can edit the 'luv.cfg' file manually by
following then same format as mentioned above.

Note: Editing is possible only in Linux systems as luv.cfg is available in boot
(second) partiton of the disk.

Netboot: In netboot image, a script is employed to edit as netboot image is an
EFI binary and is available in meta-luv/utils/modify_luv_netboot_efi.py

$ cd luv-yocto/meta-luv/utils/
luv-yocto/meta-luv/utils$ ls
modify_luv_netboot_efi.py

For the usage of the script please follow the instructions at
https://github.com/01org/luv-yocto/wiki page.
