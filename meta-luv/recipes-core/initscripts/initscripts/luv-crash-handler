# The crash handler provides a safety net to LuvOS in case there is a kernel
# crash while running the tests. It will make preparations to reboot the
# system with kexec and dump all the available crash information in the
# recovery boot.

# In regular boot, we prepare the recovery kernel and initrd image. These images
# are obtained from a disk partition identified by its UUID. Behavior changes
# according to the runlevel.
