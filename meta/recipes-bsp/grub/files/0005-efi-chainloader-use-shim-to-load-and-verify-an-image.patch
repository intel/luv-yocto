Subject: [PATCH 5/7] efi: chainloader: use shim to load and verify an image

The grub chainloader module uses the UEFI LoadImage service
to load a chainloaded binary. However, if such binary is not
signed by the UEFI certification authority, LoadImage will fail.
Under shim, we can use Machine-Owned Keys (MOKs) to verify an
image. Thus, in case LoadImage fails due to a security violation
we rely on the shim verification service. If successful, the
image is parsed and loaded.
